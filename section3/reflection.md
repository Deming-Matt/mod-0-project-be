## Section 3 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
* It was weird because I kept unconciously looking at my phone (I don't have an actual timer) and then losing focus. I think that it will take more practice in order to really use the technique well.

2. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
* I liked that my goal seemed more focused and wasn't such a 'big' project.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
* Hashes are unordered groups of information that use keys to find and use information in the hash. Array are ordered lists.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
* pet_store = {
  "Dog Food" => 23
  "Cat Food" => 45
  "Kennels" => 15
  "Kitty litter" => 27
}

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
* states["IA"]

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
states.each do

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
* Usernames and emails. An array would get really messy, where the hash you could attach usernames to emails easier.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?
* Just understanding how to access the information better.
