## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
* A growth mindset works best when you have good self discipline and when you track your goals.
* Reassessing my goals to make sure they fit the S.M.A.R.T. style to get the most out of them.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
* I have used this mindset for most of my life, but have really tried to focus on it in the past couple years.
  I do a great job understanding that mistakes are not an identity, but an event. Mistakes don't define me,
  or my abilities. Mistakes are opportunities to learn and grow.
* Where I need to get better is in asking questions rather than 'suffering' in silence.

3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
* A conditional statement evaluates if something is true/false.
  1. 5 == 6  false
  2. 4 < 8  true
  3. 17 >= 10  true

4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
* If you need input in order to run the correct code for that situation.

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
* Example:
``` Ruby
number = 3
if number == 3
  puts "Woohoo!"
else
  puts "Aw, man!"
end
  ```

6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
* Use `if` first, then add `elsif` for any others, and finally you can use the
last condition as `else`.

7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```Ruby
tired = true
if tired == false
 puts "Sweet, let's go workout!"
elsif tired == true
  puts "Okay, let's nap."
else
  puts "Well, I dunno either!"
end
```
